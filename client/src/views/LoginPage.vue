            "This app is truly a lifesaver! I have an unusual manifestation of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy 
            and must stick to a low carb diet. I recently had a back surgery that went horribly wrong.
            I was forced to stay in bed for almost a month! I had to eat whatever was brought to me 
            from the local restaurants and fast food joints. Prior to that, I had been on a strict 
            KetoDiet for years! I gained 15lbs and felt terrible.

              "I’ve been on a calorie restricted diet for years making very slow progress on my weight loss goal.
              I decided to start recording the time of my last food each day knowing that the time you eat may 
              be as important as how much you eat. It quickly became a burden and a clutter on my calendar so 
              I went looking for an intermittent fasting app. Since my original interest was just recording the
              time of my last meal I wanted a simple low/no cost app. I found only one free app that didn’t have
              in-app purchases to goof up features. Zero was that app plus it had the bonus of a 4.9 rating. ""
