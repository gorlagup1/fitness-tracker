              <p>My simplTracker App  is a fitness tracker app for runners. It tracks things like distance, pace, 
                and frequency of your runs. The app has support for Wear OS devices as well as other apps 
                like MyFitnessPal. It works pretty well. You basically hit the go button and then start running. 
                The app does the rest. It also includes a stopwatch mode for things like indoor cardio via treadmill. 
                It even has Spotify integration, although we would’ve liked integration with other music apps too. 
                In any case, like MyFitnessPal, you can get some stuff for free. 
                There is a subscription for the rest of it if you want it. It’s good for runners, but that’s about it.
